This repository represents everything needed to run trials on DynaRoach.

##run.py

This file deals with setting up a robot
and launching runs while integrating with other sensors such as the motion capture studio.

When setting up new experiments, briefly look through and modify run.py to suite your needs.

##run_cal.py
Similar to run.py except instead of running a robot, it just initializes the motion capture
studio to allow recording of a calibration rigid body. (Normally something flat that is run along
the floor to estimate floor curvature)


##natnethelper.py
Deals with getting data off of motion capture system into a csv parse-able by the rest of the system.
Functions defined here are used in run.py to get data.

##rid.py
Data used to identify runs. Saved alongside data generated by run.py

##config/
Files here are configurations that are being used for testing. They are passed in to run.py
and tell the robot what to do.

Things to do before running:
Calibrate motioncapture room.
Turn on data streaming. Set under advanced network options type to Unicast.
Ensure broadcast Frame data is checked.
Ensure the dynaroach dest address is correct in dynaroach repo.

Run mkdir test; python natnethelper.py
Ensure tests/test.csv has some frames in it.

System should be good to go, run run.py

For stable a stable phase, care has to be taken when initialy powering on the robot
as well as magnet orientation.
